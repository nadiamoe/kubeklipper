# kubeklipper

Kubeklipper is a Helm chart allowing you to deploy your 3D printer software stack in Kubernetes.

It includes:
- [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), a 3D printer firmware that runs on linux hosts and communicates with a think microcontroller counterpart in your 3D printer
- [Moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker), a web API for Klipper
- [Mainsail](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail), a slick web UI for Klipper/Moonraker
- And/or [Fluidd](https://github.com/fluidd-core/fluidd), anoter slick web UI for Klipper/Moonraker
- [ÂµStreamer](https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer), a lightweight and fast MJPEG-HTTP streamer for your webcam

Mostly autoconfigured to run out of the box*.

## Architecture

Klipper and Moonraker run together, as different containers, in the same pod. This allows them to communicate over a unix socket. You should place node selector, affinities, or resources accordingly so the node running this pod can communicate with your 3D printer via USB.

Mainsail and/or Fluidd run each one on its own pod. All of them communicate with the Klipper/Moonraker pod over HTTP, so they do not necessarily need to run on a node connected to the printer.

Finally, uStreamer also runs as an independent pod, but like Klipper/Moonraker, you should specify selectors, affinities, or resources to pin it to the node with the required webcam.

### Note on `smarter-device-manager`

I recommend [smarter-device-manager](https://gitlab.com/arm-research/smarter/smarter-device-manager) to allow pods to access device nodes (`/dev/*`), as it provides a secure way to map only certain devices to the pods, while also removing the need to set nodeSelectors or affinities.

This chart uses some of the awesome images built for the [prind](https://github.com/mkuf/prind) project.
