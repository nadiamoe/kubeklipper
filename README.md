# kubeklipper

Kubeklipper is a Helm chart allowing you to deploy your 3D printer software stack in Kubernetes.

It includes:
- [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), a 3D printer firmware that runs on linux hosts and communicates with a think microcontroller counterpart in your 3D printer
- [Moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker), a web API for Klipper
- [Mainsail](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail), a slick web UI for Klipper/Moonraker
- And/or [Fluidd](https://github.com/fluidd-core/fluidd), anoter slick web UI for Klipper/Moonraker
- [ÂµStreamer](https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer), a lightweight and fast MJPEG-HTTP streamer for your webcam

Mostly autoconfigured to run out of the box*.

## Using this chart

The kubeklipper chart is distributed as an [OCI image](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/). You can use it as a dependency if you are using Helm v3.8.0 or newer. To do so, simply add an entry to your `dependencies` array like the following:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: kubeklipper
    version: 0.1.0
    repository: oci://ghcr.io/roobre/charts
```

You can also install the chart directly:

```shell
helm install kubeklipper oci://ghcr.io/roobre/charts/kubeklipper --version 0.1.0
```

## Architecture

Klipper and Moonraker run together, as different containers, in the same pod. This allows them to communicate over a unix socket. You should place node selector, affinities, or resources accordingly so the node running this pod can communicate with your 3D printer via USB.

Mainsail and/or Fluidd run each one on its own pod. All of them communicate with the Klipper/Moonraker pod over HTTP, so they do not necessarily need to run on a node connected to the printer.

Finally, uStreamer also runs as an independent pod, but like Klipper/Moonraker, you should specify selectors, affinities, or resources to pin it to the node with the required webcam.

### Note on `smarter-device-manager`

I recommend [smarter-device-manager](https://gitlab.com/arm-research/smarter/smarter-device-manager) to allow pods to access device nodes (`/dev/*`), as it provides a secure way to map only certain devices to the pods, while also removing the need to set nodeSelectors or affinities.

## Images

This chart uses some of the awesome images built for the [prind](https://github.com/mkuf/prind) project.
